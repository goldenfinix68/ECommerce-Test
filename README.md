# Project Demo

This is a test project for full stack + blockchain developers

## Getting Started

Design and implement a small, self‑contained enhancement to this app to demonstrate full‑stack skills, code quality, and UX judgment. Keep scope tight; prefer clear, well‑tested code over breadth.


## What you will build

Enable crypto payment using MetaMask:

- Add MetaMask account connection
- "Today's ETH price" toggle button
- Show the MetaMask address of the server
- Update backend API for crypto payment
